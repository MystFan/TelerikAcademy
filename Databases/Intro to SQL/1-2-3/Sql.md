# SQL 
(Structured Query Language)

* Sql is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

* SQL consists of a **data definition language**(DDL), **data manipulation language**(DML), and a **data control language**(DCL).

* SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control.


#### DDL

> A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas 

#### DML

> A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database.


# Transact-SQL

* Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL.

* T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.

* All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.
