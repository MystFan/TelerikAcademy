Lorem ipsumstart is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography,
layout, and printing in place of English start to emphasise design elements over content start.
It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups.
It helps start to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography,
font, or layout.
Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of start a Latin text by the classical author and philospher Cicero.
Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, 
so to deliberately render its content nonsensical start; 
it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. 
While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin start, it actually has no meaning whatsoever.
As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, 
and start others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence 
of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the originalstart.
